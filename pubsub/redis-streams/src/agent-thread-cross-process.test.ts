/**
 * Cross-process AgentThreadStreamRuntime + Redis lease tests.
 *
 * Spawns N tsx child processes, each holding its own ThreadStreamRuntime +
 * stub Agent bound to a shared RedisStreamsPubSub. Drives rapid-fire signals
 * from independent processes and asserts:
 *   - exactly one worker wins the lease (its result resolves to a wake outcome with output)
 *   - the remaining signals are delivered to the winner via signal-enqueued
 *   - all runs eventually complete (no signal dropped)
 *
 * Mirrors the Vercel-Lambda topology where each request lands on a fresh
 * process with no shared in-memory state.
