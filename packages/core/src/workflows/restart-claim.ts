/**
 * Atomically adopts a new lifecycle generation for a restart or time-travel
 * execution on stores that fence the row's lifetime discriminator.
 *
 * The claim names the generation it succeeds: a write carrying a fresh
 * generation without one is indistinguishable from a delayed dead-lifetime
 * write on fenced storage, and a rejected claim means another lifetime owns
 * the run — the caller must stand down rather than execute unowned work the
 * step-persist fences would drop as `stale_execution`.
 *
 * Throws `WORKFLOW_RESTART_NOT_CLAIMED` when the compare-and-set loses, so a
 * stranded-run recovery sweep or a racing restart never enters the execution
 * engine for a lifetime it does not own.
