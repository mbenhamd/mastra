# @mastra/livekit

## 0.3.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- Added per-call speech-to-text and text-to-speech selection to `createLiveKitWorker`. Set the new `configuration.stt` and `configuration.tts` resolvers to pick the transcriber and voice for each call — one voice or language per tenant — keyed off the dispatch metadata and request context. Each resolver runs once per call and falls back to the top-level `stt` / `tts` option when it returns `undefined`. ([#19136](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19136))

  ```ts
  export default createLiveKitWorker({
    mastra,
    agent: 'support',
    stt: 'deepgram/nova-3',
    tts: 'cartesia/sonic-3', // fallback voice
    configuration: {
      // Give each tenant its own voice, resolved per call from the dispatch metadata.
      tts: ({ requestContext }) => tenantVoices[requestContext?.tenant as string],
    },
  });
  ```

  Previously the worker's speech pipeline was fixed at construction, so a multi-tenant worker could not vary voices or transcription per call. Customers who own their LiveKit session (the `MastraLLM` plugin path) already choose STT/TTS per call by construction; this brings the same flexibility to the batteries-included worker.

- Added `MastraLLM`, a standard LiveKit LLM plugin, on the new `@mastra/livekit/plugin` entry point. Build your own `voice.AgentSession` and put a Mastra agent in the `llm` slot — the agent loop, tools, and memory run on a remote Mastra server reached over HTTP, so the worker process needs no Mastra app, database, or model provider keys. ([#19136](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19136))

  Before, the worker wrapper always owned the LiveKit session:

  ```ts
  import { createLiveKitWorker } from '@mastra/livekit/worker';
  import { mastra } from './index';

  export default createLiveKitWorker({
    mastra,
    agent: 'support',
    stt: 'deepgram/nova-3',
    tts: 'cartesia/sonic-3',
  });
  ```

  Now you can own the session and keep Mastra as the LLM component:

  ```ts
  import { voice } from '@livekit/agents';
  import { MastraLLM } from '@mastra/livekit/plugin';

  const session = new voice.AgentSession({
    llm: new MastraLLM({
      remote: { baseUrl: process.env.MASTRA_URL!, agentId: 'support' },
      memory: { thread: callId, resource: userId },
    }),
    stt: 'deepgram/nova-3',
    tts: 'cartesia/sonic-3',
    // Required with `memory`: LiveKit enables preemptive generation by default.
    turnHandling: { preemptiveGeneration: { enabled: false } },
  });
  ```

  `createLiveKitWorker` stays the batteries-included path; the plugin is the composable one. Tools keep running server-side on the Mastra agent, and interrupting the agent aborts the server-side generation.

  **New transport and helpers**
  - Added `createRemoteAgentReplyGenerator()`: streams replies from a remote Mastra server over HTTP with per-turn abort, LiveKit-typed errors, and a connect + first-token timeout. It also plugs into `createLiveKitWorker`'s `generate` option to run the existing worker against a remote server.
  - Promoted `speakGreeting()`, `waitForAgentDoneSpeaking()`, and `runEndCall()` to public exports of `@mastra/livekit/worker`, so a worker that owns its session can rebuild the greeting and agent-initiated hang-up patterns in a few lines.

  **Improvements to the existing worker**
  - Interrupted turns now self-heal: when a caller interrupts a reply, nothing is persisted at that moment, and the part the caller actually heard is backfilled into the memory thread on the next turn — so saved transcripts match the call.
  - Added an `onToolCall` hook that fires as each tool call starts mid-reply, the building block for tool-driven side effects such as analytics or hang-up.
  - `onTurnComplete` now receives the turn's token usage as `result.usage`.

- Added a `configuration` option to `createLiveKitWorker` — one grouped home for conversation and compliance controls, so these don't each become a separate top-level worker option. It ships with greeting/AI-disclosure controls, a consent model, and agent-initiated hang-up, and is where further compliance controls will land. ([#19136](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19136))

  **Greeting and AI disclosure**

  `configuration.greeting` controls the opening line spoken at call start. Set `allowInterruptions: false` so a legally-required AI disclosure plays through and can't be talked over (EU AI Act Art. 50), `awaitPlayout: true` to hold post-greeting work until it finishes, and `repeatEvery` to re-disclose periodically on long calls (spoken at the next turn boundary, never mid-sentence).

  ```ts
  createLiveKitWorker({
    mastra,
    agent: 'support',
    configuration: {
      greeting: {
        text: 'You are speaking with an AI assistant. This call may be recorded. How can I help?',
        allowInterruptions: false,
        awaitPlayout: true,
        repeatEvery: 3 * 60_000, // re-disclose ~every 3 minutes
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  **Per-tenant greeting**

  `greeting.text` also accepts a resolver, called once per call with the call context, so one multi-tenant agent can open differently per tenant based on the dispatch metadata:

  ```ts
  greeting: {
    text: ({ metadata }) => `Thanks for calling ${tenantName(metadata)}. You're speaking with an AI assistant.`,
    allowInterruptions: false,
  }
  ```

  **Consent**

  `configuration.consentPolicy` declares which data-use consents a call needs, as a named, extensible set (starting with `summaryStorage`) rather than one global flag. Declaring the policy enforces nothing by itself: the new `createConsentTool` captures the caller's decision at runtime — add it to your agent and it hands each decision to your own store — and your code enforces the requirement at `onCallEnd` (or before any consent-gated step).

  ```ts
  import { createConsentTool } from '@mastra/livekit';

  // in your agent's tools:
  recordConsent: createConsentTool({
    items: ['summaryStorage'],
    onGrant: async ({ item, granted, resourceId }) => {
      if (resourceId) await db.saveConsent(resourceId, item, granted);
    },
  }),
  ```

  **Agent-initiated hang-up**

  `configuration.endCall` lets the agent end the call itself. Add the new `createEndCallTool` to your agent and instruct it to say goodbye and then call the tool; the worker waits for the closing words to finish playing, holds a short audio drain (`drainMs`, default 800ms) so the tail of the goodbye isn't clipped while it's still buffered at the caller, then hangs up — running `onCallEnd` on the way out, exactly as a caller hang-up does. It works on both the agent and workflow reply paths.

  ```ts
  import { createEndCallTool } from '@mastra/livekit';

  // in your agent's tools:
  endCall: (createEndCallTool(),
    // on the worker:
    createLiveKitWorker({ mastra, agent: 'support', configuration: { endCall: {} } }));
  ```

  **Backwards compatible**

  The previous top-level `greeting` (string) and `persistGreeting` options still work as deprecated aliases for `configuration.greeting.text` and `configuration.greeting.persist`. When both are set, `configuration.greeting` wins field by field, so existing worker configs keep running unchanged.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Added `@mastra/livekit`, a new package that turns Mastra agents into realtime voice agents using LiveKit. ([#17896](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/17896))

  LiveKit's agents framework runs the audio loop — WebRTC transport, voice activity detection, streaming speech-to-text, semantic turn detection, and barge-in — while your Mastra agent generates every reply with its own model, tools, and memory. When a caller interrupts the agent, LiveKit cancels the in-flight stream and Mastra stops generating.

  **Build a voice worker**
  - `createLiveKitWorker()` builds a LiveKit worker that answers voice sessions with your Mastra agents; `runLiveKitWorker()` starts its CLI (`dev`/`start`). Both live on the `@mastra/livekit/worker` entry point.
  - `liveKitConnectionRoute()` is an API route that mints LiveKit tokens and dispatches the voice agent into a room; `dispatchVoiceSession()` does the same programmatically for server-initiated sessions like outbound calls. These live on the `@mastra/livekit` entry point, which is safe to import from Mastra server code — it never loads the LiveKit agents runtime.

  ```ts
  // src/mastra/voice-worker.ts
  import { createLiveKitWorker } from '@mastra/livekit/worker';
  import { mastra } from './index';

  export default createLiveKitWorker({
    mastra,
    agent: 'support',
    stt: 'deepgram/nova-3',
    tts: 'cartesia/sonic-3',
    turnDetection: 'multilingual',
  });
  ```

  **Drive replies with an agent or a workflow**

  Each turn's reply can come from a Mastra agent (the default) or a Mastra workflow. With a workflow, LiveKit still owns the audio loop and calls into Mastra once per turn, so the workflow runs to completion each turn (no suspend/resume) — pass the transcript in, stream the reply out.
  - `workflow` / `workflowInput` options on `createLiveKitWorker()` drive replies with a workflow.
  - `pipeAgentReplyToWriter(agentStream, writer)` streams an agent's reply from inside a workflow step, forwarding both its words and its tool calls (piping only the text would drop the tool calls).
  - `generate` is an escape hatch to plug in any custom reply generator.

  ```ts
  export default createLiveKitWorker({
    mastra,
    workflow: 'phoneConversation',
    workflowInput: ({ messages }) => ({ turn: messages }),
    replyStep: 'generateResponse',
    stt: 'deepgram/nova-3',
    tts: 'cartesia/sonic-3',
  });
  ```

  **Run work after each turn and at the end of the call**
  - `onTurnComplete` runs once per turn, right after the reply finishes playing. It runs in the background — the worker never waits for it — so you can save memory, update your CRM, or record analytics without adding any delay for the caller or the next reply. It also runs with `result.interrupted: true` when the caller talks over the agent.
  - `onCallEnd` runs once when the call ends. Unlike `onTurnComplete`, the worker waits for it to finish before exiting, so it's the place for end-of-call work like summarizing the whole conversation into long-term memory once.
  - `toolFeedback` speaks a short phrase while a tool runs; `memoryInstance` gives the workflow path a `Memory` instance to open the call's thread and save the greeting, so the saved conversation is complete — greeting included — like the agent path.

  Both hooks work whether you drive replies with an agent or a workflow.

  ```ts
  createLiveKitWorker({
    mastra,
    agent: 'callCenter',
    onTurnComplete: async ({ result, memory }) => {
      if (memory) await crm.logContact(memory.resource, result.text);
    },
    onCallEnd: async ({ memory }) => {
      // After the caller hangs up: save a lasting summary of the call.
    },
  });
  ```

  **Built-in observability**

  When the Mastra instance has observability configured, each call opens a `voice call` trace that nests every turn's agent run and adds child spans for LiveKit's speech-to-text, text-to-speech, turn-detection, and LLM latency, closing with a per-model token, character, and audio usage roll-up. On by default; pass `observability: false` to disable.

  **Studio voice mode**

  Studio's agent chat gains a voice call mode: when the Mastra server exposes a LiveKit connection route and a voice worker is running, a phone button in the chat composer starts a realtime voice session with the agent. Live captions, agent state (listening, thinking, speaking), and barge-in all surface in the chat, and the conversation lands in the same memory thread as text chat.

  See the [LiveKit voice guide](https://mastra.ai/docs/voice/livekit) for setup.
