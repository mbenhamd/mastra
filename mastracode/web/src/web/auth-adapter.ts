/**
 * Provider-pluggable web auth seam.
 *
 * A `WebAuthAdapter` is the class a deploy entry passes to `MastraFactory`'s
 * `auth` slot. It captures exactly what the auth module (`./auth.ts`) needs
 * from an identity provider: session authentication, personal-org bootstrap,
 * the provider's public `/auth/*` routes, and how to clear its session cookie.
 * Shipped implementations: `WorkOSWebAuth` (`./auth-workos-adapter.ts`) and
 * `BetterAuthWebAuth` (`./auth-better-adapter.ts`); anything implementing this
 * interface works.
 *
 * Everything provider-NEUTRAL — the gate middleware, `/auth/me`, the tenant
 * helpers (`webAuthTenant`, `getWebAuthUser*`) — stays in `./auth.ts` and is
 * implemented against the active adapter.
