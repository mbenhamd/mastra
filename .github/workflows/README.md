# GitHub Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow files for the Mastra project.

## Canonical-only automation

Secret-bearing, publish, schedule, and upstream-maintenance jobs remain limited
to the canonical Mastra repository. These jobs use a condition that checks the
repository identity:

```yaml
if: ${{ github.repository == 'mastra-ai/mastra' }}
```

If a job already has an `if` condition, we combine them:

```yaml
if: ${{ github.repository == 'mastra-ai/mastra' && (your existing condition) }}
```

## PapersFlow fork pull requests

The `mbenhamd/mastra` fork intentionally runs a small PR validation surface:

- PR code runs only in the unprivileged `pull_request` sandbox on ephemeral
  GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-24.04` runners.
- The validator runs for PRs targeting protected `main`. Unprotected `ci/**`
  branches are not a trusted policy base.
- PF-3553 PR `#373` has one exact same-repository lane for the reviewed 22-file
  selected-route feature. The lane accepts only protected `main` as its base.
  After this policy lands, `#373` must be rebased so current `main` is an
  ancestor of the admitted head. Admission reads immutable
  Git objects from the protected base and feature head, requires the exact
  reviewed changed-path set and SHA-256 base/head surface digests, permits only
  `packages/server/package.json` and
  `server-adapters/fastify/package.json` to change in the dependency graph, and
  admits exactly `./server-adapter/selected`,
  `./server-adapter/routes/harness`, and `./selected` with their reviewed
  condition order and import, require, type, ESM, and CommonJS targets. Every
  other manifest field must remain deeply equal. Root or nested manifests,
  lockfiles, workspace policy, pnpm hooks, patches, lifecycle scripts,
  dependencies, reordered/retargeted/wildcard/extra export conditions, source
  drift, invalid JSON, deletions, and non-regular manifests fail before package
  commands run. The main validator recomputes both predicates instead of
  trusting its lane environment. Fastify remains unsupported outside this exact
  reviewed lane. A clean runner builds Server plus the LibSQL, observability,
  and MCP dependencies reached by Fastify's examples and shared tests, requires
  all nine selected export artifacts, and uses the full-suite JSON report to
  prove all three changed Fastify suites were collected and passed. The three
  reviewed Server suites receive the same exact-PF-3553 admission before each
  runs through the normal per-file JSON-report gate; the generic runtime scanner
  remains fail-closed for every other Server test.
- PF-3557 policy PR `#375` is the sole head-script bootstrap for that validator
  update. The workflow binds the bootstrap to the same-repository name, exact PR
  number, exact branch, and `main` base; later branch-name reuse cannot execute
  PR-controlled policy before the protected-base copy owns it.
- PF-558 PR `#266` has one base-owned upstream-sync lane because its reviewed
  upstream merge necessarily updates the root manifest, Server manifest,
  workspace policy, and upstream's pinned `pi-tui` patch. Admission is bound to
  the same-repository PR number, exact head/base refs, the preserved two-parent
  upstream merge commit, the exact four changed dependency-graph paths, and
  SHA-256 hashes for all three manifests, the lockfile, and that patch. Any
  additional patch, manifest, `.npmrc`, or pnpm-hook change fails before
  install. The lane installs with pnpm hooks and lifecycle scripts disabled,
  verifies Harness v1 and
  AgentController boundaries, and runs the owning Core, Server, Client SDK,
  React, MastraCode, Slack, Vercel, Harness, AgentController, and evented
  workflow build/test surface. The exception is intentionally not reusable by
  another PR or branch.
- PF-2009 PR `#277` has a second base-owned upstream-sync lane for the next
  reviewed official-main merge. Admission is bound to its exact repository,
  PR number, branch, base, both preserved two-parent merge commits, the two
  changed root dependency manifests, SHA-256 hashes for the root manifest,
  Server manifest, workspace policy, and lockfile, plus one digest covering
  every tracked package manifest, pnpm lockfile, pnpm hook, workspace file, and
  patch. The lane reuses the same explicit Harness, AgentController, workflow,
  Server, SDK, MastraCode, Slack, and Vercel validation surface without making
  the PF-558 exception reusable. Exact same-repository policy PR `#278`, its
  branch, and its `main` base may bootstrap the new validator once; every later
  PR loads it from protected base.
- PF-2045 has a topology- and tree-bound upstream-sync lane for the next
  official-main merge because its merge commit cannot be known before the
  policy lands. Admission requires the exact same-repository Linear branch and
  `main` base, and requires the checked PR head itself to have exactly two
  parents: the current protected-base tip first and reviewed upstream commit
  `4fb4d881bc107acee13890ad4d78661016c510ed` second. The trusted policy runs
  Git's merge machinery over those parents, requires exactly six rehearsed
  content conflicts, 18 base/ours/theirs stage entries, and 26 conflict
  regions, substitutes the six reviewed regular-file conflict resolutions,
  and applies two exact PF-2053 truthfulness overlays for the approval replay
  E2E and changeset. The final frozen rehearsal against base
  `711010569312141e3792be3e864ce20f010d433b` reconstructs tree
  `61e80433d05f7bf97bd51950ebab786c0a829a29`; production admission derives the
  expected tree from the current protected-base tip plus the same eight pinned
  blobs. The reviewed files are the AI SDK approval unit test, replay E2E, chat
  route, approval changeset, Core Agent stream fallback, Server agents,
  lockfile, and workspace policy.
  Wrong parents, extra parents, a non-merge head, a forged same-parent tree,
  changed conflict paths, changed resolutions or overlays, or different PR
  metadata fail before install. The lane installs the complete reconciled
  workspace with pnpm hooks and lifecycle scripts disabled, runs the shared
  Harness, AgentController, evented-workflow, Server, SDK, and MastraCode plan,
  then validates every runtime surface across the 313 incoming paths from the
  merge base to official upstream and the 312 paths in the reconciled
  first-parent merge result. The counts differ because the reviewed
  reconciliation preserves or refines fork behavior rather than accepting
  every upstream path byte-for-byte. The additional plan includes Core replay
  suites, structured-output fallback, goal, model-capability registry,
  supervisor delegation-budget enforcement, request-context-schema inference
  for dynamic skills, AI SDK A2A transformation, PF-2053
  trailing-message approval extraction and replay, the native ACP
  `createClient`/process-lifecycle contract, the full MCP client contract, the
  deterministic MCP registry list contract, Server agent authorization, docs,
  and a deterministic Memory transform/recording compatibility check. The
  nested Memory integration package's broad native suite is deliberately not
  presented as clean-runner evidence because it is outside the frozen root
  workspace and warms FastEmbed during global setup.
- `.github/workflows/papersflow-fork-pr.yml` first runs the selected trusted
  validator's complete isolated policy fixture suite, then always builds and
  type-checks Core,
  runs explicit affected-package checks for Okta Auth, Stagehand, Internal Core, CLI,
  Codemod, Deployer, MCP, Memory, Server, Fastify, AI SDK, the exact Client SDK Harness
  resource and public-entrypoint pairs, shared Storage Test Utils, PostgreSQL, Redis, Convex, LibSQL,
  Google Cloud PubSub, Redis Streams,
  Inngest, and the MastraCode SDK/TUI, and
  executes each supported changed Vitest file in full. The stateful Core Agent
  signal suite is the sole exception: the validator maps changed lines to named
  `it()`/`test()` cases with the TypeScript AST and runs each selected case in a
  fresh Vitest process. Before execution, pinned Vitest collection must resolve
  the leaf selector to exactly one full test identity; the JSON reporter must
  then prove that same file, suite path, and leaf was the sole passing case.
  The validator exercises a unique nested identity and a duplicate-leaf
  fail-closed case after its Core prerequisite checks on every run. Duplicate
  or ambiguous leaf names fail closed. Two named PubSub failure-injection fixtures map to their
  owning regression cases; all other changes to shared setup or helpers in that
  file fail closed because they cannot be covered safely by case selection. The
  exact shared Harness conformance and factory sources force the Storage Test
  Utils in-memory suite only after a TypeScript AST check proves the proposed
  factory imports `createHarnessTest` and invokes that exact binding as an
  unconditional statement in `createTestSuite`'s imported `describe` block. A
  function- and callback-level control-flow check rejects returns or throws
  that can bypass the registration, generator factories and callbacks that
  Vitest does not execute are rejected, and the call must receive only the
  exact `createTestSuite` storage binding without spreads or duplicate
  overrides. A
  second AST check runs for source or entrypoint-only changes and proves the
  in-memory entrypoint imports `createTestSuite` and invokes that exact binding
  unconditionally at module scope with an imported `MockStore`; the three files
  are then compiled together with `tsc-files`. Detached definitions, detached
  entrypoints, shadowed-import lookalikes, comment-only lookalikes, and a forced
  test beside an unrelated source fail closed even when the PR also changes a
  green Storage Test Utils suite. Other Storage Test Utils changes must enqueue
  an actually changed regular-blob Vitest file in that workspace, so dangling
  test symlinks and shared conformance helpers cannot pass without execution.
  Okta Auth runs its package
  build and lint; Deployer runs
  explicit Memory, Agent Builder, Server, Hono, and Deployer builds before its
  package typecheck, lint, and changed-test coverage. CLI builds its Deployer
  chain and direct Loggers dependency, then runs package typecheck, lint, and
  changed-test coverage. Codemod runs package typecheck, build, lint, and
  changed-test coverage. The PF-1880 real-process integration tests are owned by
  those targets; other integration-test filename variants still fail closed.
  This avoids unrelated package failures in broad Turbo dependency closures.
  Server changes run
  the package build, lint, Core-import boundary check, permission freshness
  check, both `SERVER_ROUTES` generators, and changed-test coverage. Route
  contract changes additionally typecheck the focused Client SDK route
  consumers and run the CLI descriptor suite. Route-source changes also run
  the schema-consistency and API-manifest suites even when no test was edited.
  The
  generated Client SDK route types, CLI API metadata, and Core permission
  interfaces are mapped narrowly to the Server validation lane. Route
  regeneration fails unless both route artifacts are tracked and unchanged
  from the PR head. The Server permission check owns the generated RBAC
  interface. Server and Fastify package manifest changes fail closed before
  package-owned commands run unless they satisfy the exact PF-3553 predicate.
  An admitted Fastify change retains the complete Server owner and runs a
  focused typecheck over the exact reviewed production/test sources, the
  declaration-producing package build, lint, and full Vitest suite exactly once;
  its changed tests are not repeated by the generic per-file runner. This allows
  route and permission PRs to commit canonical output
  without granting general validation coverage to the Client SDK beyond its
  exact Harness resource and public-entrypoint pairs, or to the CLI or Core
  workspaces. Direct Client Harness resource changes run the Client SDK
  typecheck, build, and lint plus the native Harness resource regression.
  Direct public-entrypoint changes run the same package checks plus the package
  export regression, always execute the generated route-consumer guard, and are
  admitted only when the complete semantic entrypoint is unchanged after
  removing exactly one added type-only `InboxResponseGeneration` named export
  from `./resources/harness`. Removing an unrelated export, changing aliases or
  generated route exports, adding side effects, or making any other entrypoint
  change fails closed before package commands run. Broader public-contract
  changes need their own reviewed validator lane. Unknown Client SDK sources and
  tests remain fail-closed. MCP runs its
  package typecheck, build, lint, and changed-test
  coverage. Nested
  fixture manifests are not treated as workspace boundaries. The validator discovers
  workspace ownership from the nearest non-fixture `package.json` and
  fails closed when a changed workspace has no owned fork-safe validation
  target. A lockfile change is compared from the PR merge base and accepted only
  when every changed importer also changes its own manifest and content outside
  the importer sections remains unchanged; root manifests, workspace
  configuration, unrelated importers, non-importer dependency-graph churn, and
  unowned lockfile-only changes still fail closed. Supported package checks use
  path-bound filters that fail when no workspace matches. The exact PF-1880 CommonJS
  fixer and Vitest configuration files receive scripts TypeScript validation
  plus changed-test execution. Root `harnessv1/sections/**/*.md` specification
  changes are the sole non-workspace documentation exception, must be regular
  blobs at the proposed head, and run through the same changed-file Prettier
  gate. Symlinks, deletions, other Harness specification inputs, and other
  non-workspace changes must match the explicit CI-rollout or changeset-metadata
  allowlist and fail closed otherwise.
- Docs Playwright changes are covered by the fork-enabled Docs E2E workflow.
  The exact Core Harness permission-gate, plan-task, and real-agent E2E suites
  are explicitly allowlisted because they use in-process stores and mock
  language models. The supervisor integration suite has a narrower exception:
  its imports and existing real-provider subtree must match the trusted base,
  the OpenAI binding and `process` credential gate cannot be reused elsewhere,
  and the runner clears any ambient OpenAI key. The tool-approval E2E exception
  similarly freezes its imports and recorder setup/lifecycle, rejects live,
  recording, spread, or in-test overrides, and runs with forced replay mode.
  The durable-agent background-task E2E
  suite is likewise allowlisted because it self-provisions its local recorder
  gateway, uses committed replay fixtures, and uses the deterministic AI SDK
  mock for its cross-turn case. The exact Server favorites integration suite is also
  allowlisted because it exercises route handlers exclusively against
  `InMemoryStore`. Every changed test must remain a regular Git blob, so an
  exact-path exception cannot be replaced by a symlink to another green suite.
  All exact-path exceptions are content-conditioned: edits
  that add Playwright, environment credentials, external provider or storage
  packages (including scoped OpenAI SDKs), or direct network/process
  primitives fail closed before the path exception is considered. Newly added
  external imports in the exact exceptions are limited to their reviewed
  in-process Core, Vitest, Zod, and safe Node surfaces. A TypeScript parser and
  module resolver follow the changed and newly reachable local runtime
  dependency graph, including `.js` specifiers that resolve to TypeScript
  source; helper-only changes re-run the owning exact test. Every changed Server
  test is screened across that incremental runtime surface before generic Vitest
  execution. The tool-approval E2E suite runs when that exact file changes but
  is not dependency-triggered while the committed replay baseline on `main`
  remains stale. Other integration-named Server tests remain fail-closed.
  Other Playwright files, `e2e-tests/**`, nested
  integration-test packages, integration-test filename variants, explicit
  provider E2E files, and PostgreSQL pooler/performance suites fail closed until
  a dedicated fork-safe workflow provides their required setup.
  The PF-2044 ownership map additionally admits only the exact Convex cache,
  LibSQL composite Harness wiring, LibSQL Harness/thread-state, Google Cloud
  PubSub group, Redis Streams PubSub, and Inngest regression files needed by
  the reviewed PF-2026/PF-2007/PF-2246 footprints. The Inngest durable-agent
  resume type contract is admitted as a typecheck-only Vitest file alongside
  the existing runtime suite. Its JSON report must contain at least one passing
  type test, so an empty assertion file cannot satisfy the contract.
  A production-only change in those paths forces its paired native test to run;
  an unrecognized source or test fails closed. Convex's admitted tests are
  mocked/in-process, LibSQL uses a local database, and the admitted Inngest
  files mock transport or execute in process. Other Convex or Inngest tests
  remain rejected because they require credentials or a dedicated dev server.
  PF-2042 has one additional exact exception:
  `workflows/inngest/src/index.test.ts`, `workflows/inngest/docker-compose.yaml`,
  and `workflows/inngest/src/__tests__/adapters/_utils.ts` must change together
  and remain regular files with the exact reviewed Git blobs and SHA-256
  digests. Trusted semantic assertions additionally bind the Compose image,
  command, port mapping, host gateway, adapter constants, and index-suite
  endpoint constructor to ports 4200/4201. The validator runs
  `docker compose config --quiet`, directly lints both TypeScript files, then
  runs the full `index.test.ts` through a trusted-workflow-started
  digest-pinned `inngest/inngest:v1.34.0` dev server on the workspace's reviewed fixed,
  non-default Inngest CLI/handler endpoint pair. The workflow never starts the
  PR-controlled Compose file; the validator parses it after the trusted content
  and endpoint checks. The service is probed before Vitest and removed in an
  always-running cleanup step. It does not execute an adapter
  integration suite, admit another adapter file or live Inngest test, or admit
  `workflows/inngest/package.json`. For that exact three-file exception only,
  the validator does not claim a package-wide typecheck/build: clean fork
  `main` and the reviewed official-upstream snapshot both have the pre-existing
  `createRun`/`RunWithRawInput` mismatch tracked by PF-2051. Any broader Inngest
  source change, including PF-2007, still enters the native package checks and
  remains blocked until that baseline is repaired. PF-2050 owns the exact
  seven-file transition from the trusted-workflow/CLI split lifecycle to one
  package runtime manager: the atomic trio, the manager source and focused
  manager test, `workflows/inngest/package.json`, and
  `.github/workflows/papersflow-fork-pr.yml`. Admission proves that the manifest
  only removes the failure-unsafe `test:docker` script, the lockfile is
  unchanged, and the workflow only removes its legacy Inngest start/environment
  mutation/cleanup steps. Unrelated manifest or workflow edits and any
  reintroduced duplicate owner fail closed. The manager-owned surface runs
  native Inngest typecheck/build/lint, the focused lifecycle test, and the live
  index suite; the validator validates Compose structure but does not prestart a
  second daemon. Default Linux uses host networking with the reviewed
  `127.0.0.1` callback, while nested Docker remains an explicit
  network-and-URL configuration. Later manager-source changes force
  `src/__tests__/inngest-test-runtime.test.ts`; both the helper and its focused
  test are owned paths. Other unowned Inngest helpers and tests remain
  fail-closed.
  PF-2236 additionally owns two process-local durable-boundary contracts.
  Changes to `workflows/inngest/src/index.ts` force
  `src/create-run-contract.test.ts`, which exercises clone metadata against a
  mocked Inngest transport. Changes to `workflows/temporal/src/workflow.ts`
  force `src/workflow.test.ts`, whose fake Temporal client proves option
  admission without starting a Temporal service. Both paths run their native
  workspace typecheck, build, and lint before the focused Vitest file. Other
  Temporal sources, tests, manifests, and non-code inputs remain fail-closed.
  Temporal builds before its self-typecheck because clean checkouts do not yet
  have the package's `dist` declarations used by integration-fixture
  self-imports.
  PostgreSQL and Redis cache production paths likewise force their newly owned
  thread-state/indexed-log regressions. Other unprovisioned Store-provider tests
  fail closed for the same reason.
- Stagehand changes build and lint the package, then run its browser-independent
  Vitest suite. The `profile-lifecycle` test remains fail-closed because it
  requires a configured Chrome executable; changing, deleting, or renaming that test requires a
  dedicated browser-capable validation lane. Maintainers can exercise the
  workspace classification and command selection locally with
  `.github/scripts/run-papersflow-fork-pr-validation.bash --self-test-stagehand`.
- Actual `mastracode/**` changes build the complete Code SDK workspace
  dependency graph, run the native SDK/TUI build, typecheck, and lint commands,
  and execute the PF-1878 login-dialog, event-dispatch, and
  notification files plus the PF-2026 goal-manager and PF-2007 SDK
  signals-pubsub regression files in full. The observation-index migration
  script and its pure record-authorization input helper are owned by the
  focused `observation-index-input` regression, so a migration cannot index
  text without forwarding its authorizing observational-memory record id. A
  TypeScript AST check additionally proves that every migration
  `indexObservation` call is direct and receives one guarded, non-escaping
  helper result in the same execution scope, belongs to the non-generator
  `indexObservationGroupsFromMessages` function reachable from the script
  entrypoint, targets that function's `memory` parameter, and is not hidden in
  a statically false or short-circuited branch. Dormant nested closures,
  generator call chains, unrelated sinks, mutations, aliases, computed element
  calls, reflective dispatch through unreviewed `memory` members, optional
  calls, `.call`/`.bind`, and other indirect method references fail closed.
  The executable script is also compiled directly when either it or its helper changes because the
  SDK's normal TypeScript and ESLint configurations exclude `scripts/**`. A
  production-only edit forces its matching regular test to run; every
  other MastraCode production JS/TS source, unit test, and nested E2E test fails closed until the targeted
  validator owns its workspace build prerequisites and test configuration. The
  canonical MastraCode build and E2E workflow stays available by manual dispatch
  in the fork; the targeted validator does not report those broad suites as PR
  coverage while current `main` has unrelated MastraCode and dependency-build
  baseline errors.
- The workflow has `contents: read`, does not receive repository secrets, and
  checks out with persisted credentials disabled. Install classification and
  validation scripts are loaded from the PR's trusted base commit, then the
  exact selected validator must pass its full isolated self-test before it can
  classify the PR. The first same-repository rollout may bootstrap only the new
  policy fixtures from its exact CI branch; external PRs may not.
- Redis cache and PostgreSQL are disposable job services matching the
  repository test ports and credentials. Redis Streams on port 6381 and the
  Google Cloud PubSub emulator on port 8085 start only when their owned
  workspaces change; both newly owned service images are pinned by immutable
  multi-architecture digest. The validator probes each required endpoint and fails
  before Vitest when the service is unavailable; none are shared runtime
  infrastructure.
- `pull_request_target` metadata workflows may use GitHub-hosted runners only
  when they check out trusted default-branch automation rather than PR code.
- Starsling remains available only to same-repository branches in the canonical
  repository; external pull-request heads use GitHub-hosted runners there too.
  Canonical-only workflows, including the initial Prebuild change detector,
  must guard every Starsling job so fork PRs skip rather than wait forever for
  a runner the fork cannot access.

Run the validator's focused policy fixtures locally after changing its routing
or command plan:

```bash
.github/scripts/run-papersflow-fork-pr-validation.bash --self-test
.github/scripts/run-papersflow-fork-pr-validation.bash --self-test-pf3553-selected-route-exports
.github/scripts/run-papersflow-fork-pr-validation.bash --self-test-pf558-upstream-sync
.github/scripts/run-papersflow-fork-pr-validation.bash --self-test-pf2009-upstream-sync
.github/scripts/run-papersflow-fork-pr-validation.bash --self-test-pf2045-upstream-sync
.github/scripts/run-papersflow-fork-pr-validation.bash --self-test-pf2247-upstream-sync
```

The fixtures use an isolated temporary Git repository and mocked package
commands. They prove Server permission and route-generation selection, map
each generated artifact back to Server even when it is the only changed file,
reject stale or deleted generated output, reject unsupported Server and Fastify
manifest changes before package commands run, exercise route-contract and
generated-consumer checks,
run route consistency coverage and the exact fork-safe favorites integration
test, reject exact and ordinary Server tests when their changed or newly
reachable local dependencies gain unsafe runtime requirements, distinguish real
imports from comments, and keep other integration-named tests fail-closed.
They also prove production-only forced-test selection, direct test selection,
native command routing, service-unavailable failure, the exact Client Harness,
LibSQL composite, Inngest type-contract, MastraCode observation-index, and
regular-blob Harness specification routes (including symlink rejection), exact
deterministic Core integration/E2E paths,
shared Harness conformance ownership and direct typechecking, rejection of
observation-index helper bypass, shadowing, mutation, nested closure, or
indirect, computed, or reflective invocation, statically unreachable or
short-circuited indexing, detached, shadowed, async, outer-guarded,
callback-guarded, generator-backed, reassigned, or storage-overridden factory
registration, entrypoint-only detachment, dangling test symlinks, exact Core
exception symlinks, frozen supervisor provider gating, strict tool-approval
replay routing and recorder-override rejection, and forced-test substitution for an authored
Storage Test Utils regression. An aggregate PF-2246 fixture proves those routes compose
without a later fail-closed gate masking incomplete coverage. They also accept the atomic
PF-2042 Inngest test/Compose/adapter-launcher trio, reject each unpaired member,
reject a valid-but-misaligned port topology, reject the Inngest manifest and
unknown live tests, and propagate Compose validation failure before executing
package commands. PF-2045 fixtures separately create the six genuine content
conflicts, prove the accepted reconstructed merge tree, the exact frozen
rehearsal-tree assertion, all six conflict resolutions, and both PF-2053
non-conflict overlays. They also prove that a benign non-conflicting
protected-base advance reconstructs and passes, and exercise wrong-upstream,
wrong-first-parent, forged-resolution, forged-overlay,
forged-same-parent-tree, protected-base conflict-input drift, extra-parent,
non-merge, and wrong-metadata failures. PF-2247 fixtures separately bind its
trusted lane to the exact reviewed merge commit, ordered parent pair, tree,
repository metadata, and protected-base intersection. They reject forged trees,
reversed and extra parents, non-merge heads, unreviewed base lineages, and
wrong branch metadata.
The PF-3553 fixtures separately prove both reviewed base refs and the exact
additive export maps, and reject
script, lifecycle, dependency, files-list, lockfile, workspace, nested
manifest, pnpm-hook, patch, export-retarget, traversal, wildcard, extra,
missing, invalid, deleted, non-regular, wrong-metadata, lane-spoof, and unknown
workspace mutations. Their command log also proves the complete Server owner
is retained and each Fastify typecheck, build, lint, and full Vitest command
runs exactly once.

Do not register a self-hosted runner for public PR code. Keep canonical
release, secret, cloud, and scheduled workflows gated to `mastra-ai/mastra`
unless a separately reviewed fork policy explicitly owns them.
