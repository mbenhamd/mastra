Fixed MCP server notifications (resource updates, resource/prompt list changes) not reaching clients connected over streamable HTTP. Notifications are now broadcast to every connected session across all transports.

Fixed resource subscriptions being shared globally across all clients. Subscriptions are now tracked per session, so `resources.notifyUpdated()` only notifies sessions that subscribed to the resource URI, and one client unsubscribing no longer removes another client's subscription. Clients that relied on receiving `notifications/resources/updated` without subscribing must now call `resources/subscribe` first.

Added support for the remaining MCP notification features:

**Dynamic tools and tools/list_changed**

Servers can now add and remove tools at runtime and notify clients via `notifications/tools/list_changed`:

```typescript
// Server: manage tools at runtime
await server.toolActions.add({ myNewTool });
await server.toolActions.remove(['myNewTool']);
await server.toolActions.notifyListChanged();
```

When the server is registered with a Mastra instance, dynamic add/remove also keeps the Mastra instance's tool registry in sync.

```typescript
// Client: react to tool list changes
await mcp.tools.onListChanged('myServer', async () => {
  const tools = await mcp.listTools();
});
```

**Server-side log messages**

Servers can now emit `notifications/message` log notifications. The minimum level a client sets via `logging/setLevel` is honored per session:

```typescript
// Broadcast to all connected clients
await server.sendLoggingMessage({ level: 'info', data: { message: 'Sync completed' } });

// From inside a tool, send to the calling client
await context.mcp.log('debug', 'Fetching weather', { location });
```

**Progress notifications from tools**

Tools can now report progress to the calling client:

```typescript
await context.mcp.progress({ progress: 1, total: 3, message: 'step 1' });
```
