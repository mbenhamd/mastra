Collapsed the result of `agent.sendSignal` / `sendMessage` / `queueMessage` / `sendStateSignal` / `sendNotificationSignal` into a single `accepted` promise that resolves at decision-time to a discriminated union: `{ action: 'wake'; runId; output }` when the signal started a run in this process, `{ action: 'deliver'; runId }` when it was forwarded onto an existing run, or `{ action: 'persist' }` / `{ action: 'discard' }` when nothing ran. `runId` is present only on `wake`/`deliver`; for `persist`/`discard` correlate via `result.signal.id`. `accepted` resolves for routing decisions and rejects only when the signal couldn't be routed at all (e.g. misconfigured agent). This replaces the old `accepted: true` boolean and the best-effort top-level `runId`. `result.persisted` stays top-level. `sendNotificationSignal`'s `accepted` is optional (a notification may be dropped by policy with no signal) — read `result.decision` for the policy verdict.

On serverless platforms, when this process/Lambda is the one that woke the run (`action === 'wake'`), it can use the platform's `waitUntil` to keep itself alive until the run it started completes — otherwise the runtime may be frozen or torn down mid-run:

```ts
const result = agent.sendSignal(signal, { resourceId, threadId });
ctx.waitUntil(
  result.accepted.then(async accepted => {
    if (accepted.action === 'wake') await accepted.output.consumeStream();
  }),
);
```

Added a `LeaseProvider` capability (`acquireLease` / `releaseLease` / `renewLease` / `getLeaseOwner` / `transferLease`) — distributed leasing kept separate from event delivery (`PubSub`) — so processes racing to wake the same thread coordinate a single owner. The winner runs the stream; losers forward their signal to it. `EventEmitterPubSub` leases in-memory; `RedisStreamsPubSub` uses `SET NX PX` with owner-verified Lua scripts for release, renew, and transfer; the default `NoopLeaseProvider` always wins, preserving single-process behavior.

Fixed a cross-process race where, after a run finished, the thread's lease briefly went free before its queued follow-up work started — letting another process win the lease and start a competing run for the same thread. The owner now keeps the lease until all queued work is drained. The lease TTL and renewal interval are overridable for tests via `MASTRA_AGENT_THREAD_LEASE_TTL_MS` and `MASTRA_AGENT_THREAD_LEASE_RENEW_INTERVAL_MS` (production defaults unchanged).
